                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>NVIDIA is just too big in market share</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">3DCenter recently released more information about GPU market share, and the results aren’t that surprising. This is mainly because NVIDIA has held the majority of the GPU market share since 2002, gradually making the gap between them and AMD bigger and bigger. Intel isn't even in the picture, which is unsurprising. According to 3DCenter data, NVIDIA began to ramp up production using the GeForce 500 series GPUs in 2010 which probably the moment when they became the top dog they are now.
<br>
<br>
<br>As you can see, the green line is NVIDIA while the red line is AMD, and the gap between them is just too big for AMD to catch up. As for right now, NVIDIA is at an 88% while AMD is at a disappointing 12%. It seems they have a plan to make their GPU sector at least a bit profitable, since AMD, in an interview with Tom's Hardware, confirmed that its next generation of gaming GPUs based on the RDNA 4 graphics architecture will not target the enthusiast graphics segment. Speaking with Paul Alcorn, AMD's Computing and Graphics Business Group head, Jack Huynh, said that with its next generation, AMD will focus on gaining market share in the PC gaming graphics market.
<br>
<br>For those who don’t get what he means, in plain language, they’re trying to move from the ‘budget’ GPUs to the more ‘mid-range to mid-high’ GPUs.
<br><br>
<br>In my opinion, I don’t think this will work for them. The ‘thing’ with AMD was raw performance to price ratio. AMD was always a great option for people who wanted to not spend 4 figures on one out of the several pc components you need to buy. Pulling out wouldn’t be a good idea.
<br>
<br>What I think they should actually do is upgrade their software. I don’t mean their drivers and stuff, they’re great, but they are totally lacking in software like NVIDIA’s dlss, NVIDIA’s Broadcast, and even NVIDIA’s recording system. NVIDIA just offers you so much software that just makes using a PC so much easier. AMD just doesn’t have software even close to that level.
<br>
<br>Also, something AMD can do nothing about is that a lot of NVIDIA’s market share comes from reputation. NVIDIA’s always the brand when you think of ‘GPU’, its even worse now since NVIDIA peaked a few months ago and became the most valuable company. That’s something AMD will have to deal in the future with marketing and such.
<br>
<br>I really hope AMD keeps making GPUs, mainly because competition is always good, making companies develop better and more competitive products and nobody wants to see a monopoly happen, especially in the GPU sector where it’s going to play a huge role in both AI and PCs of ordinary individuals.</p>
